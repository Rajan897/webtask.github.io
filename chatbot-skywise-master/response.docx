Question: What is React Server Components (RSC)?
Answer: React Server Components (RSC) were announced as an experimental demo in December 2020.

Question: When was React Server Components (RSC) announced?
Answer: React Server Components (RSC) were announced in December 2020.

Question: What has been the progress since the announcement of React Server Components?
Answer: Since the announcement of React Server Components, progress has been made in finishing up its dependencies in React 18 and working on changes inspired by experimental feedback.

Question: What significant change has been made regarding I/O libraries in React Server Components?
Answer: The idea of having forked I/O libraries (e.g., react-fetch) has been abandoned in favor of adopting an async/await model for better compatibility.

Question: How does the change in I/O libraries affect the release of React Server Components?
Answer: The change in I/O libraries does not technically block the release of React Server Components because routers can also be used for data fetching.

Question: What approach is being adopted instead of the file extension approach in React Server Components?
Answer: React Server Components are moving away from the file extension approach in favor of annotating boundaries.

Question: Who is collaborating to unify bundler support for React Server Components?
Answer: Collaboration is happening with Vercel and Shopify to unify bundler support for React Server Components in both Webpack and Vite.

Question: What is the objective before the launch of React Server Components?
Answer: Before the launch of React Server Components, the objective is to ensure that the semantics of RSCs are the same across the entire React ecosystem. This is the major blocker for reaching stability.

Question: What types of assets are typically preloaded and loaded using external systems?
Answer: Scripts, external styles, fonts, and images are typically preloaded and loaded using external systems.

Question: What is the current challenge with coordinating assets across new environments like streaming and server components?
Answer: It can be tricky to coordinate assets across new environments like streaming and server components.

Question: What is the proposed solution to address the challenge of coordinating assets across different environments?
Answer: APIs are being considered to preload and load deduplicated external assets through React APIs that work in all React environments.

Question: How is the support for Suspense being integrated with asset loading?
Answer: Support for Suspense is being integrated so that images, CSS, and fonts can block display until they're loaded without blocking streaming and concurrent rendering.

Question: What issue does integrating Suspense with asset loading aim to resolve?
Answer: Integrating Suspense with asset loading aims to avoid "popcorning," where visuals pop and layout shifts occur due to assets being loaded asynchronously.

Question: What are the two techniques mentioned as great ways to achieve performance for cacheable pages?
Answer: Static Site Generation (SSG) and Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) are mentioned as great ways to achieve performance for cacheable pages.

Question: What is the focus of the optimization efforts for dynamic Server Side Rendering (SSR)?
